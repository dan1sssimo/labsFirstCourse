                <p>The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes,
                    sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking back and
                    shaking his head and threatening what he would do to Tom
                    the "next time he caught him out." To which Tom responded
                    with jeers, and started off in high feather, and as soon
                    as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone,
                    threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned
                    tail and ran like an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home,
                    and thus found out where he lived. He then held a position
                    at the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside,
                    but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and
                    declined. At last the enemy's mother appeared, and called
                    Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away.
                    So he went away; but he said he "'lowed" to "lay" for that boy.</p>
